CLOSURE
Vars within a FN are removed after FN ceases.
This is way in which you can access a var within the scope of an object.
When you use an anon FN the variable within this FN is not removed when FN exits and is stored within the Constructor FN.

STRICT EQULAITY
Use this if you dont want any unpredictable results with type coercion

OOJ
If you want to use an obj in multiple instances with variations use Constructor FN:
function Constructor() { }

To add properties to a CF use Constructor.prototype.newProp = foo;

To create new instance/obj of CF use var newObj = new Constructor;

Properties + Values within CF make use of = ; instead of "",

RECURSION:

var x = 0;

function recursiveCall ( ) {
    if ( x < 5 ) {
        x += 1;
        console.log(x);
        recursiveCall();
    } else {
        return;
    }
}
recursiveCall();
