CHAPTER 2: JS IN HTML

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATTRS
defer - external scripts | download immed | exec deferred
async - external scripts | no guarantee on order | not recommended for dom mods

* use these on body of comments for enterprise apps

STRICT MODE

function blah() {
"use strict"
}

Removes erratic ECMA3 behaviours
Always include a semi-colon so u can compress JS files

Keywords & Reserved Terms

VARIABLES
var key;  // var declaration
var key = 0;  // var initialisation

When creating a var with var keyword the variable is local to the FN and destroyed when FN exits.
var minus the var keyword are global. Using this method is not recommended as it isnt clear if ommision of var keyword is deliberate or not.


DATA TYPES

============================================================================

6 Types

Undefined
String
Number
Boolean
Object
Function

alert (typeof message); //String
alert (typeof (message)); //String

typeof doesnt require brackets as it is an operator

typeof confusion
typeof null returns obj (null is considered an empty obj)
typeof regExp returns either Obj or func in various browsers

Technically fns are considered objcts in ECMA  but do have special props which necessitates the differentiation between an OBJ.


UNDEFINED

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Has only one val: undefined

This was created to run comparisons. When a var is declared but is not initialised it has a val of undef.
Undeclared/commented vars like 

// var age 

can only have typeof run on it which is generally undef

var msg;
// var age;

alert typeof age; // undef
alert typeof msg; // undef

It's advised that you always initialise vars so you know for sure why a var returns a val of undef.



THE NULL TYPE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Has only one val: null
null is an empty obj.
undefined and null are related.
alert(null ==  undefined); // true

var car = null;

When defining a var that is meant to hold an obj later its advisable to define it as null. That way you can explicity test
to see if the var has been filled with an obj.

Anytime an obj is expected but isnt available null should be used in its place. This is what 

eg: if(car != null)


BOOLEAN
